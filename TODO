Things to do:

* NTLM SSO auth with current user using C++ add on inspired by ntlmauth.dll from jTDS
** would love to use node-ffi here once Windows support is complete
* Make bigints into strings and allow user to decide what to do w/ them (e.g. node-bigint)
* Fix parameterized binary pieces from buffer (hangs statement right now)
* Prepared statements
* SQL bulk load
* TDS server impl too?
* Query cancellation support
* Transaction support
* Multiple result set test
